Supervised Learning - the algorithm was fed a dataset with the "right answers"
    The algorithm then tries to predict the price of a house with an arbitrary number of square feet
This is a regression problem: Predict continuous valued output

Tumor example - discrete values, either benign or malignant
This is a classification problem: discrete valued output. May be more than just two outputs


We may have a large number of features:
    Age, Tumor Size, Clump Thickness, Uniformity of Cell Size, Uniformity of Cell Shape
We want to be able to handle an infinite number of attributes. 
    How do we store an infinite number of things?
    Support Vector Machines offer a neat mathematical trick    
    
Problem 1: You have a large inventory of identical items, you want to predict how many of these items will sell over the next three months
    Regression - continuous over N

Problem 2: You'd like software to examine individual customer accounts and for each account decide if it has been hacked/compromised
    Classification - discrete binary states

Correct
